This project is about Book Management System and it is still under development. This project will help the Librarian to save time in sorting books, taking inventory of new purchased books and tracking the issuance of books to students,this project solves most problems faced by many High Schools and Tertiary institutions in Afric from rigorous outdated manual and analog cataloging of books to digital and easy way of cataloging books. I am currently building and designing this using C#- programming language(Form App) for the front end, connected to a Database, but for the purpose of this prototype am using Ms Access.
